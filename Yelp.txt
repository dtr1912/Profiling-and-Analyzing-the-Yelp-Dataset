Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 6493
viii. Tip = 3979 (FK: business_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
I pick:
	City: Las Vegas 
        Category: Shopping

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

No both the groups have a similar distribution of hours.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes the 5 star rated has different number of reviews with 2-3 star but the sample size is too small for forming conclusions only 4 observations.
 
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

No the location data looks inconclusive.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT id, 
       name, 
       city, 
       category,
       review_count, 
       hours, 
       stars,
       postal_code,
       latitude,
       longitude,
       CASE WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
            WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
            ELSE stars
       END 
FROM business b 
JOIN category c ON b.id = c.business_id
JOIN hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE (city ='Las Vegas' AND category ='Shopping') 
ORDER BY stars
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
The businesses that are open tend to have more reviews than ones that are closed on sum.

+-----------+--------------+
| is_open_1 | total_review |
+-----------+--------------+
| Closed    |        35261 |
| Opened    |       269300 |
+-----------+--------------+
         
ii. Difference 2:
The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than businesses that are closed.
+-----------+-------------------+
| is_open_1 |          avg_star |
+-----------+-------------------+
| Closed    | 3.520394736842105 |
| Opened    | 3.679009433962264 |
+-----------+-------------------+

         
SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT CASE WHEN is_open = 0 THEN 'Closed'
            WHEN is_open = 1 THEN 'Opened'
            ELSE NULL
       END is_open_1,
       SUM(review_count) total_review,
       AVG(stars) avg_star
FROM business b 
GROUP BY is_open
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
Analysing the kind of cuisine popular in a city based on number of restaurants and its star rating and reviews as per yelp data.   
For the analyses I picked up data of restaurants with specific cuisines like “Chinese”,”Mexican”,”Korean”,”French”,”Italian”,”Japanese” and “Indian”. Then I analyzed their number of outlets in a city, their star ratings and number of reviews to get some insights on which type of food is popular in a city on yelp.   
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
